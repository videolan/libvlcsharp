### What is the current *bug* behavior?

<!-- What actually happens -->

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

<!-- What you should see instead -->

### Does it work on other plaforms? Does it work with the official VLC apps?

<!-- Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise. 

If the VLC Windows app (GPL) does not have the issue and you're using the LGPL version of LibVLC in your app, consider this as possible reason for these differences in behavior -->

### Relevant LibVLC logs and/or screenshots

<!-- Paste any relevant logs from your app and/or from LibVLC (`new LibVLC(enableDebugLogs: true)`).
Please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise. -->
