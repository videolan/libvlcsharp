[![Build Status](https://videolan.visualstudio.com/LibVLCSharp/_apis/build/status/LibVLCSharp-GitLab?branchName=master)](https://videolan.visualstudio.com/LibVLCSharp/_build/latest?definitionId=10?branchName=master)

LibVLCSharp is a cross-platform audio and video API for .NET platforms based on VideoLAN's LibVLC Library.
It provides a comprehensive multimedia API that can be used across mobile, server and desktop to render video and output audio as well as encode and stream.

_The official repository URL for this repo is https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp._

## Features

Check out [libvlc-nuget](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlc-nuget) to get a basic understanding of how `libvlc` works, what it can offer and how to install it with NuGet. 

Some of the [features](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html) include:

- Network browsing for distant filesystems (SMB, FTP, SFTP, NFS...).
- HDMI pass-through for Audio HD codecs, like E-AC3, TrueHD or DTS-HD.
- Stream to distant renderers, like Chromecast.
- 360 video and 3D audio playback with viewpoint change.
- Support for Ambisonics audio and more than 8 audio channels.
- Subtitles size modification live.
- Hardware decoding and display on all platforms.
- DVD playback and menu navigation.
- Equalizer support.

Most things you can achieve with the regular VLC desktop app, you can also achieve using `libvlc`.

## Supported platforms

Mono, .NET Framework and .NET Core runtimes are supported.

- Xamarin.Android
- Xamarin.iOS
- Xamarin.tvOS
- Xamarin.Mac (Cocoa)
- Windows (WPF, WinForms, GTK)
- Linux (GTK)
- Xamarin.Forms
- .NET Standard 1.1
- .NET Core (including ASP.NET Core)

## Installation

1. Install LibVLC in your platform specific project.

```cmd
dotnet add package VideoLAN.LibVLC.[Windows|Android|iOS|Mac|tvOS]
```

LibVLC is the actual VLC engine written mostly in C/C++ and compiled for your target platform. More information [here](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlc-nuget).

2. Install LibVLCSharp _or_ LibVLCSharp.Forms (if you plan on using Xamarin.Forms)

LibVLCSharp is the .NET wrapper that consumes `LibVLC` and allows you to interact with native code from C#/F#.

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp
```

[![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/LibVLCSharp.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp)

If you plan to use LibVLCSharp with Xamarin.Forms, you need to install LibVLCSharp.Forms instead (which references LibVLCSharp).

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.Forms
```

[![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LibVLCSharp.Forms.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.Forms)
[![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/LibVLCSharp.Forms.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.Forms)

The LibVLCSharp package contains platform specific View integrations (i.e. `VideoView`) for Android, iOS, Mac and tvOS.

3. A few additional GUI toolkits have been integrated to LibVLCSharp. Those _optional_ packages aim to make the process of using LibVLC in your app as easy and fast as possible by providing a LibVLCSharp `VideoView`.

For __WPF__ on Windows with or without Xamarin.Forms
[![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LibVLCSharp.WPF.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.WPF)

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.WPF
```

or

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.Forms.WPF
```

For __WinForms__ on Windows [![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LibVLCSharp.WinForms.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.WinForms)

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.WinForms
```

If you're using __GTK__ (with or without Xamarin.Forms support) on Linux and/or Windows [![NuGet Stats](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LibVLCSharp.GTK.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.GTK)

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.GTK
```

## Getting started

Feel free to check out the simple sample projects for [iOS](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/LibVLCSharp.iOS.Sample) and [Android](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/LibVLCSharp.Android.Sample) to get started.

- You need to instantiate a `VideoView` and add it to your main View. 
- You may need to call `Core.Initialize()` to load the `libvlc` native libraries, depending on your host platform. 
- The `VideoView` offers a `MediaPlayer` object (with data-binding support) which allows you to control playback with APIs such as `Play`, `Pause`, set a new media or listen for `libvlc` events.

For usage of the API, you should check out the `libvlc` [C API documentation](https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc.html) which this wrapper follows closely.

Regarding LibVLCSharp.Forms, check out the sample for [Forms](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/Forms) to get started.
Notably, make sure to call `LibVLCSharpFormsRenderer.Init()` in your platform specific project [*before*](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/57605/#Comment_57605) `Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init` is called.

## Samples

For more advanced samples, have a look at [libvlcsharp-samples](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples). It currently includes:

- [Chromecast sample](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/tree/master/Chromecast): Discover chromecasts on your local network and select one for playback in 100% shared code (Xamarin.Forms, iOS/Android).
- [Record HLS sample](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/tree/master/RecordHLS): Simple .NET Core CLI app which shows how to record an HLS stream to the filesystem.
- [RTSP Mosaic](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/tree/master/VideoMosaic): Cross-platform RTSP player sample with 4 views mosaic (Xamarin.Forms, iOS/Android).
- [PulseMusic UX](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/tree/master/PulseMusic): A stylish music player UX example using Skia on iOS and Android.
- [Gestures sample](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/tree/master/Gestures/Gestures): Cross-platform touch gestures and 360 videos on iOS and Android.

Feel free to suggest and contribute new samples.

## Quick API overview

- [`LibVLC.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/LibVLC.cs): Main object pointing to a native `libvlc` instance in native code.
- [`MediaPlayer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/MediaPlayer.cs): Manages playback, offers event listeners and more. Accessible from `VideoView` with data-binding support.
- [`Media.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/Media.cs): Class representing and providing information about a media such as a video or audio file or stream.
- `VideoView.cs`: Custom native view which holds a `MediaPlayer` object.
- [`MediaDiscoverer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/MediaDiscoverer.cs): This object should be used to find media on NAS and any SMB/UPnP-enabled device on your local network.
- [`RendererDiscoverer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/RendererDiscoverer.cs): Use this to find and use a Chromecast or other distant renderers.
- [`Dialog.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/Dialog.cs): Dialogs can be raised from the `libvlc` engine in some cases. Register callbacks with this object.
