## Goal

LibVLCSharp's goal is to support all .NET runtimes (Xamarin/Mono, .NET Core and .NET Framework) on most operating systems by targeting .NET Standard 2.0.

We also aim to provide you with a custom video control integrated with the OS native UI toolkit. That means integration with UWP, Cocoa (Xamarin.Mac), GTK# and game engines with Mono support (Unity, Unreal, Godot). For a current status, see [Supported platforms](#supported-platforms) and [Roadmap](#roadmap).

`libvlc` is a complete, opensource and crossplatform multimedia framework written in C. On the other hand, Xamarin allows true crossplatform .NET code on all platforms and provides an efficient way to build crossplatform UIs with Xamarin.Forms.

LibVLCSharp is designed to be the connecting layer in between `libvlc` and Xamarin.

Using LibVLCSharp means you can take advantage of all `libvlc` features from shared managed code (C#/F#), in a true crossplatform way. You may use the features described below on all [supported platforms](#supported-platforms) by LibVLCSharp.

## Features

Check out [libvlc-nuget](https://github.com/mfkl/libvlc-nuget) to get a basic understanding of how `libvlc` works, what it can offer and how to install it with NuGet. 

Some of the features include:

- Network browsing for distant filesystems (SMB, FTP, SFTP, NFS...).
- HDMI passthrough for Audio HD codecs, like E-AC3, TrueHD or DTS-HD.
- Stream to distant renderers, like Chromecast.
- 360 video and 3D audio playback with viewpoint change.
- Support for Ambisonics audio and more than 8 audio channels.
- Subtitles size modification live.
- Hardware decoding and display on all platforms.
- DVD playback and menu navigation.

Most things you can achieve with the regular VLC desktop app, you can also achieve using `libvlc`.

## Supported platforms

- Xamarin.Android
- Xamarin.iOS
- Xamarin.Mac
- Windows (WPF/WinForms)
- Xamarin.Forms
    - iOS
    - Android
    - Mac
    - WPF
- Unity
    - Android

## Installation

You need to install 2 packages to get started.

The first is `libvlc`, which is the actual VLC engine written mostly in C/C++ and compiled for your target platform. You can find information about it and how to download it on NuGet [here](https://github.com/mfkl/libvlc-nuget).

The second package you need is LibVLCSharp, the .NET wrapper that consumes `libvlc` and allows you to interact with native code from C#/F#. 

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp
```

https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp

If you plan to use LibVLCSharp with Xamarin.Forms, you need to install LibVLCSharp.Forms instead (which references LibVLCSharp).

```cmd
dotnet add package LibVLCSharp.Forms
```

https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp.Forms/

## Getting started

Feel free to check out the simple sample projects for [iOS](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/LibVLCSharp.iOS.Sample) and [Android](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/LibVLCSharp.Android.Sample) to get started. 

Basically, you need to instantiate a `VideoView` and add it to your View. It handles the required `libvlc` initialization for you on each platform, and offers a `MediaPlayer` .NET object on which you can call `Play`, `Pause`, set a new media or listen for `libvlc` events.

For usage of the API, you should check out the `libvlc` [C API documentation](https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc.html) which this wrapper follows closely.

Regarding LibVLCSharp.Forms, check out the sample for [Forms](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/tree/master/Samples/Forms) to get started.
Notably, make sure to call `LibVLCSharpFormsRenderer.Init()` in your platform specific project [*before*](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/57605/#Comment_57605) `Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init` is called.

## Samples

For more advanced samples, have a look at [libvlcsharp-samples](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples). It currently includes:

- Chromecast sample: Discover chromecasts on your local network and select one for playback in 100% shared code (Xamarin.Forms, iOS/Android).
- Record HLS sample: Simple .NET Core CLI app which shows how to record an HLS stream to the filesystem.

Feel free to suggest and contribute new samples.

## Quick API overview

- `VideoView.cs`: Custom view which holds a `LibVLC` object and a `MediaPlayer` object.
- [`LibVLC.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/LibVLC.cs): Main object pointing to a native `libvlc` instance in native code. Accessible from `VideoView`.
- [`MediaPlayer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/MediaPlayer.cs): Manages playback, offers event listeners and more. Accessible from `VideoView`.
- [`MediaDiscoverer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/MediaDiscoverer.cs): This object should be used to find media on NAS and any SMB/UPnP-enabled device on your local network.
- [`RendererDiscoverer.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/RendererDiscoverer.cs): Use this to find and use a Chromecast or other distant renderers.
- [`Media.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/Media.cs): Class representing and providing information about a media such as a video or audio file or stream.
- [`Dialog.cs`](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp/blob/master/LibVLCSharp/Shared/Dialog.cs): Dialogs can be raised from the `libvlc` engine in some cases. Register callbacks with this object.

## Roadmap
